    "7. Reflect on your experience interacting with ChatBot and describe how your perception of AI-driven assistance tools in the context of learning coding, statistics, and data science has been evolving (or not) since joining the course\n",
    "\n",
    "## I've coded before, so using a chatbot hasn't necessarily expanded my knowledge. However, as I mentioned earlier, chatbots are useful for handling straightforward tasks, such as writing a code description for the Monty Hall problem. From my perspective, AI tools can significantly save time for workers or students, allowing them to focus on more creative and complex jobs. One of the major challenges we face in society is the loss of information as it gets transferred(imagine if we could inherit Einstein's understanding of physics from birth; how different would the world be if everyone had access to such knowledge?) AI-driven tools have helped streamline the transfer of information, making communication more efficient. That, to me, is their greatest benefit so far."
